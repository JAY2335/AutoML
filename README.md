# üî•AutoMLüî•
> Your one-stop for developing automated machine learning pipelines!

## What is it?
AutoML is a web based no-code Machine Learning application which enable users to perform machine learning algorithms just by uploading a
dataset. It reduces huge amounts of time to analyse datasets and build model with the most common ML Algorithms. 
It also produces specific model accuracy plots for user to know which model suits the dataset well. 
Very simplistic and easy design which enables even beginners to follow easily.

## Top Features
- Developed with 6 classification algorithms + 4 regression algorithmsüö®
- Preprocess broken dataset automatically within few seconds‚ö°Ô∏è
- Auto-generated visualisations for each stage of preprocessing for user to note their decisions ‚úÖ
- Amazing Chart analysis of accuracies of models, so that user can analyse the best model for their datasetüìù
